The /proc File System
=====================

The /proc file system offer an additional mechanism for the kernel and 
kernel modules to send information to the processes.

The method to use is similar to the one used with device drivers.
A structure is created to containing all the information needed for the 
/proc file, including a pointers to handler functions.

"init_module" registers the structure and "cleanup_module" unregisters 
it.

No functions of the module get called when the file is opened or close. 
Therefore we cannot use the "try_module_get" and "try_module_put" in 
this module.
If the file is opened and then the module is removed, there is no way 
to avoid the consequences.


Steps :
	Create entry in module_init
	Create file system functions
		open
		read
		close
	Delete entry in module_cleanup
